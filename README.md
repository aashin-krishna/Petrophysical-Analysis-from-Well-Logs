# Petrophysical Analysis from Well Logs â›½ðŸ“Š

A Python-based toolkit for analyzing well log data (LAS/CSV) to derive petrophysical properties and identify reservoir-quality zones. Includes data preprocessing, curve standardization, and automated calculation of porosity, water saturation, and shale volume.

---

## Features

* Reads and processes LAS/CSV well log files (`lasio`, `pandas`).
* Quality control: missing value handling, outlier clipping, and unit normalization.
* Calculates porosity (density-neutron), water saturation (Archieâ€™s equation), and Vshale.
* Visualizations of log curves, crossplots, and reservoir intervals.
* Generates concise statistical summaries for reservoir evaluation.
